# ESP32 Ideas

A curated collection of ESP32 sketches exploring different IoT scenarios—from access points with on-device displays to smart watering systems. Each idea lives in its own folder with source code, wiring diagrams, and supporting assets so you can jump straight into prototyping.

## Highlights

- **Modular concepts** – Every directory contains a standalone experiment built around the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **Ready-to-flash sketches** – Upload the provided `.ino` files to start testing immediately.
- **Supporting visuals** – Find images, wiring schemas, and version notes alongside the code to guide your build.

## Getting Started

1. **Install tooling** – Use the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO with ESP32 board support installed.
2. **Clone the repository** – `git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/esp32-ideas.git`
3. **Pick a project** – Open any `.ino` sketch inside the project folders.
4. **Configure hardware** – Reference the accompanying `images/` and `schema/` assets to wire sensors and actuators.
5. **Flash and test** – Compile and upload to your ESP32, then iterate on the idea.
